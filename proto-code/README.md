# Prototype code

This folder contains prototype code used to develop the main project.

Each Python file contains a header comment explaining what the code is doing
and the goal of the prototype.

- `iss_location.py`: A CPython (the Python running on your computer) script to
  get the current ISS location and show it on a map.
- `iss_location_micropython.py`: A simple MicroPython script to get the current
  ISS location and print its latitude/longitude to serial.
